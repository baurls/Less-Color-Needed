# Less-Color-Needed

The goal of this small sheet is to rebuild a given image with as few different colors possible.

## Why?
Let's assume you're the inventor of the kids game 'Malen nach Zahlen', where children can paint your picture template with a certain amount of given colors.
Now the question is, on a given picture and a fixed amount of colors allowed, which colors should I pick, to still obtain a good result?

This sheet could answer your question.


## Quick Results
Here you can see some results of the program.  

### k=16
Here, you see some comparisons between the original input image on the left and the color-reduced image on the right. 

For all instances I used max. 16 colors.
